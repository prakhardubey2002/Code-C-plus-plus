we can use constructor in derived class in c++
if base class constructor does not have any arguments,ther is no need of any constructor in derived class.
BUt if ther are one or more argument in the base class constructor,derived class need to pass argument to the base class constructor 
if both base and derived class have constructor ,base class constructor is executed first.
The cosntstuctor of virtual base class is given preference over non virtusl class
if multiple virtual class are declared then they will execute in  order of declarstion
